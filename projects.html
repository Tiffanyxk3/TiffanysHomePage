            * Focused on multi-label sentiment analysis on Yelp restaurant
            reviews by clustering the reviews into related categories such as
            level of taste, environment, service, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            * Implemented two class and multinomial Naive Bayes model, LSTM
            model in Python, each having accuracy 62%, 70% and 78%.

            * Extracted data from an XML document and stored them relationally
            in a SQLite database.
          </p>
          <p>
            * Created an “analytical” database using a star schema in MySQL.
          </p>
          <p>
            * Facts are queried from the MySQL database while the two databases
            are connected simultaneously.

        <div class="proj3-content">
          <p>
            * Developed and built an educational game aiming to teach users
            concepts and knowledge of system design, where users are
          </p>
          <p>
            allowed to incorporate the knowledge and adapt to different tasks
            provided in the game to learn and understand system design
          </p>
          <p>
            * Used JavaScript to build the logic and the webpage using the
            Kaboom library.

        <div class="proj4-content">
          <p>
            * Devised and created a search engine supported by a self-built
            multithreaded web crawler using Java.
          </p>
          <p>
            * Built a thread-safe inverted index to store the mappings from word
            stems to documents and position within those documents
          </p>
          <p>
            where those word stems were found is stored. Multithreading is
            supported by using a work queue to build and search an inverted
            index with multiple threads.
